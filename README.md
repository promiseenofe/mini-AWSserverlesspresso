# mini-AWSserverlesspresso
The mini project captures the core concept of a serverless coffee order system:  User signup with custom auth triggers  Orders stored in DynamoDB  Basic Lambda backend serving orders  Minimal monitoring/logging extension  But it does not implement the full complexity or feature set of the official workshop.
